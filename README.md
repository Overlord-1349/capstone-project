## About this project

This is a feedback survey project, there are  3 simple questions users have to answer and the results are saved on a file for further processing.

The main idea of this project was to implement at least one of the capabilities of the openai, I wanted to focus on functions since due to the nature of my work this is the one that made more sense to m, since quite often we may need to trigger a process, fetch additional information or any other action depending on the user inputs.
